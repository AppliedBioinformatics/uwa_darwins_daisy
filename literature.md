## The Radiation of Darwin’s Giant Daisies in the Galápagos Islands. [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220313506)
This is an important paper that forms a major background of the project. I have summarised some of the findings below
that will support the evidence the manuscript will present.

1) The paper provides good evidence that the Galápagos Islands were mostly formed **before** the diversification of 
_scalasia_. Except for Fernandina (of which we have no data), and Isabela that formed around the same time that 
diversification of _scalasia_ began to occur in the Island group.

2) The paper provides good evidence that Darwin's daisies (DD) do not follow the progression rule that hypothesises that
older islands should host older, more diverged species. For example, the paper shows that the oldest Island -
San Cristobal hosts many of the late-diverging species. As less recently diverged species seem to populate the central
islands, this paper implies that Darwin's daisies may have radiated outwards from the central island groups (Santiago,
Floreana, Isabela). Our SGSGeneLoss results also suggest gene loss between the central Islands and San Cristobal.

3) The paper supports _scalasia_ seeming to undergo within-island speciation. I.e , an initial migration event, followed
by intra-island speciation/diversification. If this is the case, we should still see gene loss across the islands 
radiating outwards from the central islands.
